# Extra Incentives

Stakers have been the recipients of a variety of additional recognition, income, and related opportunities. These include airdrops, NFTs, and access to communities. The following list documents known historical instances of such incentives and may change over time.

## Airdrops

Stakers have periodically received airdrops as recognition for their contributions to securing the Ethereum network. You can learn more about past airdrops by visiting the [Airdrops](/airdrops) page.

## Communities

Several communities have formed to support and recognize the efforts of stakers. These communities provide resources, opportunities, and support networks to enhance the staking experience. Learn more about these by visiting the [Allied Communities](/communities) page.

## NFT Projects

Some projects have launched NFTs specifically targeted at stakers to reward them for their commitment to securing the network. One such notable project is:

- [Guardians of the Ether](https://www.etherguardians.xyz/): A collection that recognizes the contributions of Ethereum stakers.

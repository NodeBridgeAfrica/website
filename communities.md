## Stakers Union

The Stakers Union is a collective of solo-stakers for the Ethereum network.

### Purpose

Incentives for solo-stakers are dwindling. Liquid staking and restaking protocols and their associated liquid tokens drive many away from solo-staking. The Stakers Union is building a registry of solo-stakers to support their activities by securing stable incentives from ecosystem participants functioning similarly to the [Protocol Guild](https://protocol-guild.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) which supports Ethereum core developers.

### Membership

The Stakers Union has developed a multi-step [verification process](https://docs.stakersunion.com/membership/verification) and is accepting members.
